# Rock_Paper_Scissors



Description : Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors". This C++ Program [Mini Project] is aimed at automating one of the player called as Computerized Player and the taking rock, paper or scissor as an input from the used.




## Rules

A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen
scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"),
but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock");
a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").
If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and
is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
